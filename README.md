This repository denotes my  wingify ui assignment to create seperate popup based on the desktop / mobile orientation along with form validation, store data in cookies using vennila js.

## Task 1. For Desktop, create an exit intent popup with the following design. Below is the functionality we are expecting: 
Criteria :

● Successful submission: create cookie & auto close the popup. 
● On Closing the popup(whether the form is filled or not) a cookie will be created. 
● On refresh: if any of the above-created cookies(i.e. successful submission or close) are present, then exit intent popup should not appear.

## Task 2 . Make a mobile version of the as shown below. The scope will be different here, instead of exit intent the popup should auto appear after 5 seconds.
